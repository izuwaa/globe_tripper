1.4: Helper functions
This helper function manages a complete conversation session, handling session creation/retrieval, query processing, and response streaming.

async def run_session(
    runner_instance: Runner, user_queries: list[str] | str, session_id: str = "default"
):
    """Helper function to run queries in a session and display responses."""
    print(f"\n### Session: {session_id}")

    # Create or retrieve session
    try:
        session = await session_service.create_session(
            app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session_id
        )
    except:
        session = await session_service.get_session(
            app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session_id
        )

    # Convert single query to list
    if isinstance(user_queries, str):
        user_queries = [user_queries]

    # Process each query
    for query in user_queries:
        print(f"\nUser > {query}")
        query_content = types.Content(role="user", parts=[types.Part(text=query)])

        # Stream agent response
        async for event in runner_instance.run_async(
            user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session.id, new_message=query_content
        ):
            if event.is_final_response() and event.content and event.content.parts:
                text = event.content.parts[0].text
                if text and text != "None":
                    print(f"Model: > {text}")


print("✅ Helper functions defined.")
✅ Helper functions defined.
1.5: Configure Retry Options
When working with LLMs, you may encounter transient errors like rate limits or temporary service unavailability. Retry options automatically handle these failures by retrying the request with exponential backoff.

retry_config = types.HttpRetryOptions(
    attempts=5,  # Maximum retry attempts
    exp_base=7,  # Delay multiplier
    initial_delay=1,
    http_status_codes=[429, 500, 503, 504],  # Retry on these HTTP errors
)
🤓 Section 2: Memory Workflow
From the Introduction section, you now know why we need Memory. In order to integrate Memory into your Agents, there are three high-level steps.

Three-step integration process:

Initialize → Create a MemoryService and provide it to your agent via the Runner
Ingest → Transfer session data to memory using add_session_to_memory()
Retrieve → Search stored memories using search_memory()
Let's explore each step in the following sections.

Memory workflow

🧠 Section 3: Initialize MemoryService
3.1 Initialize Memory
ADK provides multiple MemoryService implementations through the BaseMemoryService interface:

InMemoryMemoryService - Built-in service for prototyping and testing (keyword matching, no persistence)
VertexAiMemoryBankService - Managed cloud service with LLM-powered consolidation and semantic search
Custom implementations - You can build your own using databases, though managed services are recommended
For this notebook, we'll use InMemoryMemoryService to learn the core mechanics. The same methods work identically with production-ready services like Vertex AI Memory Bank.

memory_service = (
    InMemoryMemoryService()
)  # ADK's built-in Memory Service for development and testing
3.2 Add Memory to Agent
Next, create a simple agent to answer user queries.

# Define constants used throughout the notebook
APP_NAME = "MemoryDemoApp"
USER_ID = "demo_user"

# Create agent
user_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite", retry_options=retry_config),
    name="MemoryDemoAgent",
    instruction="Answer user questions in simple words.",
)

print("✅ Agent created")
✅ Agent created
Create Runner
Now provide both Session and Memory services to the Runner.

Key configuration:

The Runner requires both services to enable memory functionality:

session_service → Manages conversation threads and events
memory_service → Provides long-term knowledge storage
Both services work together: Sessions capture conversations, Memory stores knowledge for retrieval across sessions.

# Create Session Service
session_service = InMemorySessionService()  # Handles conversations

# Create runner with BOTH services
runner = Runner(
    agent=user_agent,
    app_name="MemoryDemoApp",
    session_service=session_service,
    memory_service=memory_service,  # Memory service is now available!
)

print("✅ Agent and Runner created with memory support!")
✅ Agent and Runner created with memory support!
‼️ Important
💡 Configuration vs. Usage: Adding memory_service to the Runner makes memory available to your agent, but doesn't automatically use it. You must explicitly:

Ingest data using add_session_to_memory()
Enable retrieval by giving your agent memory tools (load_memory or preload_memory)
Let's learn these steps next!

3.3 MemoryService Implementation Options
This notebook: InMemoryMemoryService

Stores raw conversation events without consolidation
Keyword-based search (simple word matching)
In-memory storage (resets on restart)
Ideal for learning and local development
Production: VertexAiMemoryBankService (You'll learn this on Day 5)

LLM-powered extraction of key facts
Semantic search (meaning-based retrieval)
Persistent cloud storage
Integrates external knowledge sources
💡 API Consistency: Both implementations use identical methods (add_session_to_memory(), search_memory()). The workflow you learn here applies to all memory services!

💾 Section 4: Ingest Session Data into Memory
Why should you transfer Session data to Memory?

Now that memory is initialized, you need to populate it with knowledge. When you initialize a MemoryService, it starts completely empty. All your conversations are stored in Sessions, which contain raw events including every message, tool call, and metadata. To make this information available for long-term recall, you explicitly transfer it to memory using add_session_to_memory().

Here's where managed memory services like Vertex AI Memory Bank shine. During transfer, they perform intelligent consolidation - extracting key facts while discarding conversational noise. The InMemoryMemoryService we're using stores everything without consolidation, which is sufficient for learning the mechanics.

Before we can transfer anything, we need data. Let's have a conversation with our agent to populate the session. This conversation will be stored in the SessionService just like you learned in the previous notebook.

# User tells agent about their favorite color
await run_session(
    runner,
    "My favorite color is blue-green. Can you write a Haiku about it?",
    "conversation-01",  # Session ID
)
### Session: conversation-01

User > My favorite color is blue-green. Can you write a Haiku about it?
Model: > A tranquil blend,
Ocean's calm and nature's green,
Peace in every hue.
Let's verify the conversation was captured in the session. You should see the session events containing both the user's prompt and the model's response.

session = await session_service.get_session(
    app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id="conversation-01"
)

# Let's see what's in the session
print("📝 Session contains:")
for event in session.events:
    text = (
        event.content.parts[0].text[:60]
        if event.content and event.content.parts
        else "(empty)"
    )
    print(f"  {event.content.role}: {text}...")
📝 Session contains:
  user: My favorite color is blue-green. Can you write a Haiku about...
  model: A tranquil blend,
Ocean's calm and nature's green,
Peace in ...
Perfect! The session contains our conversation. Now we're ready to transfer it to memory. Call add_session_to_memory() and pass the session object. This ingests the conversation into the memory store, making it available for future searches.

# This is the key method!
await memory_service.add_session_to_memory(session)

print("✅ Session added to memory!")
✅ Session added to memory!
🔎 Section 5: Enable Memory Retrieval in Your Agent
You've successfully transferred session data to memory, but there's one crucial step remaining. Agents can't directly access the MemoryService - they need tools to search it.

This is by design: it gives you control over when and how memory is retrieved.

5.1 Memory Retrieval in ADK
ADK provides two built-in tools for memory retrieval:

load_memory (Reactive)

Agent decides when to search memory
Only retrieves when the agent thinks it's needed
More efficient (saves tokens)
Risk: Agent might forget to search
preload_memory (Proactive)

Automatically searches before every turn
Memory always available to the agent
Guaranteed context, but less efficient
Searches even when not needed
Think of it like studying for an exam: load_memory is looking things up only when you need them, while preload_memory is reading all your notes before answering each question.

5.2 Add Load Memory Tool to Agent
Let's start by implementing the reactive pattern. We'll recreate the agent from Section 3, this time adding the load_memory tool to its toolkit. Since this is a built-in ADK tool, you simply include it in the tools array without any custom implementation.

# Create agent
user_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite", retry_options=retry_config),
    name="MemoryDemoAgent",
    instruction="Answer user questions in simple words. Use load_memory tool if you need to recall past conversations.",
    tools=[
        load_memory
    ],  # Agent now has access to Memory and can search it whenever it decides to!
)

print("✅ Agent with load_memory tool created.")
✅ Agent with load_memory tool created.
5.3 Update the Runner and Test
Let's now update the Runner to use our new user_agent that has the load_memory tool. And we'll ask the Agent about the favorite color which we had stored previously in another session.

👉 Since sessions don't share conversation history, the only way the agent can answer correctly is by using the load_memory tool to retrieve the information from long-term memory that we manually stored.

# Create a new runner with the updated agent
runner = Runner(
    agent=user_agent,
    app_name=APP_NAME,
    session_service=session_service,
    memory_service=memory_service,
)

await run_session(runner, "What is my favorite color?", "color-test")
### Session: color-test

User > What is my favorite color?
WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts. Check the full candidates.content.parts accessor to get the full model response.
5.4 Complete Manual Workflow Test
Let's see the complete workflow in action. We'll have a conversation about a birthday, manually save it to memory, then test retrieval in a new session. This demonstrates the full cycle: ingest → store → retrieve.

await run_session(runner, "My birthday is on March 15th.", "birthday-session-01")
### Session: birthday-session-01

User > My birthday is on March 15th.
Model: > Okay, I will remember that your birthday is on March 15th.
Now manually save this session to memory. This is the crucial step that transfers the conversation from short-term session storage to long-term memory storage.

# Manually save the session to memory
birthday_session = await session_service.get_session(
    app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id="birthday-session-01"
)

await memory_service.add_session_to_memory(birthday_session)

print("✅ Birthday session saved to memory!")
✅ Birthday session saved to memory!
Here's the crucial test: we'll start a completely new session with a different session ID and ask the agent to recall the birthday.

# Test retrieval in a NEW session
await run_session(
    runner, "When is my birthday?", "birthday-session-02"  # Different session ID
)
### Session: birthday-session-02

User > When is my birthday?
WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts. Check the full candidates.content.parts accessor to get the full model response.
Model: > Your birthday is on March 15th.
What happens:

Agent receives: "When is my birthday?"
Agent recognizes: This requires past conversation context
Agent calls: load_memory("birthday")
Memory returns: Previous conversation containing "March 15th"
Agent responds: "Your birthday is on March 15th"
The memory retrieval worked even though this is a completely different session!

🚀 Your Turn: Experiment with Both Patterns
Try swapping load_memory with preload_memory by changing the tools array to tools=[preload_memory].

What changes:

load_memory (reactive): Agent decides when to search
preload_memory (proactive): Automatically loads memory before every turn
Test it:

Ask "What is my favorite color?" in a new session
Ask "Tell me a joke" - notice that preload_memory still searches memory even though it's unnecessary
Which pattern is better for different use cases?
5.5 Manual Memory Search
Beyond agent tools, you can also search memories directly in your code. This is useful for:

Debugging memory contents
Building analytics dashboards
Creating custom memory management UIs
The search_memory() method takes a text query and returns a SearchMemoryResponse with matching memories.

# Search for color preferences
search_response = await memory_service.search_memory(
    app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, query="What is the user's favorite color?"
)

print("🔍 Search Results:")
print(f"  Found {len(search_response.memories)} relevant memories")
print()

for memory in search_response.memories:
    if memory.content and memory.content.parts:
        text = memory.content.parts[0].text[:80]
        print(f"  [{memory.author}]: {text}...")
🔍 Search Results:
  Found 4 relevant memories

  [user]: My favorite color is blue-green. Can you write a Haiku about it?...
  [MemoryDemoAgent]: A tranquil blend,
Ocean's calm and nature's green,
Peace in every hue....
  [user]: My birthday is on March 15th....
  [MemoryDemoAgent]: Okay, I will remember that your birthday is on March 15th....
🚀 Your Turn: Test Different Queries
Try these searches to understand how keyword matching works with InMemoryMemoryService:

"what color does the user like"
"haiku"
"age"
"preferred hue"
Notice which queries return results and which don't. What pattern do you observe?

💡 Key Insight: Memory search is grounded in reality - agents can't hallucinate memories that don't exist.

5.6 How Search Works
InMemoryMemoryService (this notebook):

Method: Keyword matching
Example: "favorite color" matches because those exact words exist
Limitation: "preferred hue" won't match
VertexAiMemoryBankService (Day 5):

Method: Semantic search via embeddings
Example: "preferred hue" WILL match "favorite color"
Advantage: Understands meaning, not just keywords
You'll explore semantic search in Day 5!

🤖 Section 6: Automating Memory Storage
So far, we've manually called add_session_to_memory() to transfer data to long-term storage. Production systems need this to happen automatically.

6.1 Callbacks
ADK's callback system lets you hook into key execution moments. Callbacks are Python functions you define and attach to agents - ADK automatically calls them at specific stages, acting like checkpoints during the agent's execution flow.

Think of callbacks as event listeners in your agent's lifecycle. When an agent processes a request, it goes through multiple stages: receiving the input, calling the LLM, invoking tools, and generating the response. Callbacks let you insert custom logic at each of these stages without modifying the core agent code.

Available callback types:

before_agent_callback → Runs before agent starts processing a request
after_agent_callback → Runs after agent completes its turn
before_tool_callback / after_tool_callback → Around tool invocations
before_model_callback / after_model_callback → Around LLM calls
on_model_error_callback → When errors occur
Common use cases:

Logging and observability (track what the agent does)
Automatic data persistence (like saving to memory)
Custom validation or filtering
Performance monitoring
📚 Learn More: ADK Callbacks Documentation

image.png

6.2 Automatic Memory Storage with Callbacks
For automatic memory storage, we'll use after_agent_callback. This function triggers every time the agent finishes a turn, then calls add_session_to_memory() to persist the conversation automatically.

But here's the challenge: how does our callback function actually access the memory service and current session? That's where callback_context comes in.

When you define a callback function, ADK automatically passes a special parameter called callback_context to it. The callback_context provides access to the Memory Service and other runtime components.

How we'll use it: In our callback, we'll access the memory service and current session to automatically save conversation data after each turn.

💡 Important: You don't create this context - ADK creates it and passes it to your callback automatically when the callback runs.

async def auto_save_to_memory(callback_context):
    """Automatically save session to memory after each agent turn."""
    await callback_context._invocation_context.memory_service.add_session_to_memory(
        callback_context._invocation_context.session
    )


print("✅ Callback created.")
✅ Callback created.
6.3 Create an Agent: Callback and PreLoad Memory Tool
Now create an agent that combines:

Automatic storage: after_agent_callback saves conversations
Automatic retrieval: preload_memory loads memories
This creates a fully automated memory system with zero manual intervention.

# Agent with automatic memory saving
auto_memory_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite", retry_options=retry_config),
    name="AutoMemoryAgent",
    instruction="Answer user questions.",
    tools=[preload_memory],
    after_agent_callback=auto_save_to_memory,  # Saves after each turn!
)

print("✅ Agent created with automatic memory saving!")
✅ Agent created with automatic memory saving!
What happens automatically:

After every agent response → callback triggers
Session data → transferred to memory
No manual add_session_to_memory() calls needed
The framework handles everything!

6.4 Create a Runner and Test The Agent
Time to test! Create a Runner with the auto-memory agent, connecting the session and memory services.

# Create a runner for the auto-save agent
# This connects our automated agent to the session and memory services
auto_runner = Runner(
    agent=auto_memory_agent,  # Use the agent with callback + preload_memory
    app_name=APP_NAME,
    session_service=session_service,  # Same services from Section 3
    memory_service=memory_service,
)

print("✅ Runner created.")
✅ Runner created.
# Test 1: Tell the agent about a gift (first conversation)
# The callback will automatically save this to memory when the turn completes
await run_session(
    auto_runner,
    "I gifted a new toy to my nephew on his 1st birthday!",
    "auto-save-test",
)

# Test 2: Ask about the gift in a NEW session (second conversation)
# The agent should retrieve the memory using preload_memory and answer correctly
await run_session(
    auto_runner,
    "What did I gift my nephew?",
    "auto-save-test-2",  # Different session ID - proves memory works across sessions!
)
### Session: auto-save-test

User > I gifted a new toy to my nephew on his 1st birthday!
Model: > That's wonderful! A 1st birthday is such a special milestone. I hope your nephew enjoys his new toy!

### Session: auto-save-test-2

User > What did I gift my nephew?
Model: > You gifted your nephew a new toy on his 1st birthday.
What just happened:

First conversation: Mentioned gift to nephew
Callback automatically saved to memory ✅
Second conversation (new session): Asked about the gift
preload_memory automatically retrieved the memory ✅
Agent answered correctly ✅
Zero manual memory calls! This is automated memory management in action.

6.5 How often should you save Sessions to Memory?
Options:

Timing	Implementation	Best For
After every turn	after_agent_callback	Real-time memory updates
End of conversation	Manual call when session ends	Batch processing, reduce API calls
Periodic intervals	Timer-based background job	Long-running conversations
🧩 Section 7: Memory Consolidation
7.1 The Limitation of Raw Storage
What we've stored so far:

Every user message
Every agent response
Every tool call
The problem:

Session: 50 messages = 10,000 tokens
Memory:  All 50 messages stored
Search:  Returns all 50 messages → Agent must process 10,000 tokens
This doesn't scale. We need consolidation.

7.2 What is Memory Consolidation?
Memory Consolidation = Extracting only important facts while discarding conversational noise.

Before (Raw Storage):

User: "My favorite color is BlueGreen. I also like purple. 
       Actually, I prefer BlueGreen most of the time."
Agent: "Great! I'll remember that."
User: "Thanks!"
Agent: "You're welcome!"

→ Stores ALL 4 messages (redundant, verbose)
After (Consolidation):

Extracted Memory: "User's favorite color: BlueGreen"

→ Stores 1 concise fact
Benefits: Less storage, faster retrieval, more accurate answers.

Memory consolidation

7.3 How Consolidation Works (Conceptual)
The pipeline:

1. Raw Session Events
   ↓
2. LLM analyzes conversation
   ↓
3. Extracts key facts
   ↓
4. Stores concise memories
   ↓
5. Merges with existing memories (deduplication)
Example transformation:

Input:  "I'm allergic to peanuts. I can't eat anything with nuts."

Output: Memory {
  allergy: "peanuts, tree nuts"
  severity: "avoid completely"
}
Natural language → Structured, actionable data.

7.4 Next Steps for Memory Consolidation
💡 Key Point: Managed Memory Services handle consolidation automatically.

You use the same API:

add_session_to_memory() ← Same method
search_memory() ← Same method
The difference: What happens behind the scenes.

InMemoryMemoryService: Stores raw events
VertexAiMemoryBankService: Intelligently consolidates before storing
